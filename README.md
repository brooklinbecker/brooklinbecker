👋 Hi, I’m @brooklinbecker. I am a student at the University of Toronto pursuing my Bachelor's with the Faculty of Information.

👀 I’m interested in performative architecture, data humanism, and technofeminism and embodiment in today's cyborg century.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R, and how to coduct qualitative and quantitative data research and analysis.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research and data analysis projects which relate to parental grief and grieving in general.
